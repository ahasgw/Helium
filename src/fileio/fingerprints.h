   *
   * @section fingerprints_files Fingerprint File Classes
   *
   * To create Helium binary fingerprint files, the RowMajorFingerprintOutputFile
   * and ColumnMajorFingerprintOutputFile classes can be used. The difference
   * between row-major and column-major order files is explained below.
   *
   * For reading fingerprints, the InMemoryRowMajorFingerprintStorage and
   * InMemoryColumnMajorFingerprintStorage classes can be used. The classes
   * load and keep the fingerprint data in main memory. As an alternative,
   * the memory mapped equivalents MemoryMappedRowMajorFingerprintStorage and
   * MemoryMappedColumnMajorFingerprintStorage classes can be used. Additional
   * fingerprint storage classes can be added by following the fingerprint
   * storage concept described below.
   *
   * @section fingerprints_file_format Binary File Format
   *
   * Like all Helium binary files, the fingerprint file formats include a JSON
   * header containing all information about the binary data contained in the
   * file. Below is an example of such a header.
   *
@code
{
  'filetype': 'fingerprints',
  'order': 'row-major',
  'num_bits': 1024,
  'num_fingerprints': 1000000,
  'fingerprint': {
    'name': 'My custom fingerprint',
    'type': 'Helium::trees_fingerprint',
    'k': 7,
    'prime': 1021
  }
}
@endcode
   *
   * For fingerprint files the 'filetype' attribute will always be 'fingerprints'.
   * The 'order', 'num_bits', 'num_fingerprints' and 'fingerprint' attributes are
   * mandatory.
   * In the 'fingerprint' attribute, only the 'name' and 'type' attributes are
   * mandatory. Additional attributes may always be added such as the 'k' and
   * 'prime' attributes in the example above. (note: These last two attributes
   * may be required by an application that needs to compute the fingerprint for
   * a query molecule)
   *
   * While the 'name' attribute is mainly meant for end user purposes, the 'type'
   * attribute should be a string that corresponds to the method used for
   * generating the fingerprints (e.g. 'MyChemLib::some_fingerprint'). The
   * remaining attributes may then be used to specify parameters for this
   * fingerprint type.
   *
   * @section fingerprints_rowcol Row-Major vs. Column-Major Order
   *
   * Fingerprints can be stored in row-major order (i.e. each fingerprint is
   * stored in consecutive memory) or in column-major order (i.e. each
   * fingerprint bit is stored consecutively in memory). To illustrate the
   * difference, consider storing these 8-bit fingerprints for four molecules:
   *
@verbatim
molecule 1: 00101100
molecule 2: 10001011
molecule 3: 00000110
molecule 4: 10101100
@endverbatim
   *
   * In the row-major order storage, the fingerprints are stored by concatenating
   * the above fingerprints. In the figure below, the addresses are bit addresses
   * in hexadecimal. Using this storage method, the bits of an individual
   * molecule's fingerprint are stored consecutively.
   *
@verbatim
0x00  00101100
0x08  10001011
0x10  00000110
0x18  10101100
@endverbatim
   *
   * In the column major order, the fingerprint are stored by concatenating the
   * columns. As a result, the individual fingerprint bits for all molecules are
   * stored consecutively. This can be seen in the figure below.
   *
@verbatim
0x00  0101
0x04  0000
0x08  1001
0x0C  0000
0x10  1101
0x14  1011
0x18  0110
0x1C  0100
@endverbatim
   *
   * The difference between these two methods of storing fingerprints can
   * dramatically influence the performance of an application. Due to various
   * hardware properties, sequential memory accesses are much faster than random
   * memory access patterns. Therefore it is vital to choose the correct storage
   * methods for each application.
   *
   * @section fingerprints_similarity Storing Fingerprints for Similarity Searches
   *
   * Similarity searches are performed by computing the similarity between the
   * query and queried molecules fingerprints. Although a variety of similarity
   * measures can be used the Tanimoto coefficient is very the most widely used.
   *
   * \f[
   *   T_{\mathrm{sim}} = \frac{| A \wedge B |}{| A \vee B |}
   * \f]
   *
   * Here \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$ are the query and queried fingerprint bitstrings
   * and \f$|A|\f$ is the population count of fingerprint \f$A\f$.
   *
   * Since the whole fingerprint is needed to compute the similarity,
   * fingerprints for similarity searches are stored in row-major order.
   *
   * @section fingerprints_substructure Storing Fingerprints for Substructure Searches
   *
   * When performing a substructure search the fingerprints are used to filter out
   * molecules that will never match the query. All molecules that do not have
   * all bits set in their fingerprint that are set in the query's fingerprint
   * can never match the query. If the fingerprints (i.e. bitstrings) are
   * interpreted as sets where the value of the i-th bit would signify whether
   * the element i is in the set or not, this filtering can be seen as checking
   * if the query fingerprint is a subset of the molecule's fingerprint (which
   * would than be the superset).
   *
   * Let \f$M\f$ be set of all queried molecules\f$m\f$, \f$F\f$ be the set of all
   * possible fingerprints and \f$\mathrm{finger}: M \mapsto F\f$ be the function
   * assigning a fingerprint to a molecule. Then the set \f$I\f$ of molecules that
   * potentially contain the query is given by
   *
   * \f[
   *   I = \{ \forall m \in M \vert \mathrm{finger}(q) \subseteq \mathrm{finger}(m) \}
   * \f]
   *
   * where \f$q\f$ is the query.
   *
   * Constructing the set \f$I\f$ can easily be done by iterating over all
   * molecules (i.e. stored fingerprints) and adding them to \f$I\f$ if the
   * subset test passes. Although this would work, it is not very efficient.
   * A large portion of the data has to be processed that is not strictly
   * needed. A better way is to only check the bits that are set in the
   * query's fingerprint. While this is better in theory, care has to be taken
   * to implement this efficiently too. Checking only a single fingerprint bit
   * at a time using the row-major order storage would be very inefficient due
   * to random access memory patterns. To address this issue the column-major
   * order storage is used for substructure searching. It should also be noted
   * that constructing the final set \f$I\f$ can be done using the bitwise AND
   * operator on the bitstrings for the fingerprint bits that are set in the
   * query.
   *
   * A concrete example will illustrate how this works:
   *
@verbatim
query: 00001011 (bit 5, 7 & 8 are set)

0x00  0101
0x04  0000
0x08  1001
0x0C  0000
0x10  1101 <- bit 5
0x14  1011
0x18  0110 <- bit 7
0x1C  0100 <- bit 8

1101 & 0110 & 0100 = 0100 -> only molecule 2 can contain the query
@endverbatim
   *
   * In this example only 3 bitstrings have to be accessed. For this 8-bit
   * fingerprint this results in 62.5% less data that has to be processed.
   * Using a real fingerprint this may easily exceed 90% of the data (e.g.
   * a 1024-bit query fingerprint has 100 bits set).
   *
   * @section fingerprints_storage Fingerprint Storage Concepts
   *
   * In order for the indexing and search algorithms to work with various kind
   * of ways to actually store the fingerprints (e.g. read from disk on demand,
   * read from file and keep in main memory, memory mapped file, read from
   * database, ...), a concept for each major order is defined.
   *
   * @subsection fingerprints_storage_rowmajor Row-Major Order
   *
   * A class that is a model of the RowMajorFingerprintStorageConcept must support
   * the following operations:
   *
   * @code
   * std::string json = storage->header();
   * unsigned int n = storage->numBits();
   * unsigned int n = storage->numFingerprints();
   * Helium::Word *fingerprint = storage->fingerprint(index);
   * @endcode
   *
   * In the code above, storage is a pointer to an instance of a type that is a
   * model of the concept and index is an unsigned int. The index refers to the
   * molecule for which to get the fingerprint bitstring and should be in the
   * range [0, num_fingerprints). The returned pointer should point to a memory
   * location containing (for example) 1024 bits for a 1024-bit fingerprint.
   *
   * @subsection fingerprints_storage_colmajor Column-Major Order
   *
   * A class that is a model of the ColumnMajorFingerprintStorageConcept must support
   * the following operations:
   *
   * @code
   * std::string json = storage->header();
   * unsigned int n = storage->numBits();
   * unsigned int n = storage->numFingerprints();
   * Helium::Word *bit = storage->bit(index);
   * @endcode
   *
   * In the code above, storage is a pointer to an instance of a type that is a
   * model of the concept and index is an unsigned int. The index refers to the
   * bit in the fingerprint (e.g. in the range [0,1023] for a 1024-bit
   * fingerprint). The returned pointer should point to a memory location
   * containing num_fingerprints bits.
